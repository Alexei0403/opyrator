- üîå&nbsp; Auto-generated HTTP API based on FastAPI.
- üåÖ&nbsp; Auto-generated Web UI based on Streamlit.
- üì¶&nbsp; Save and share as self-contained executable file or Docker image.
- üß©&nbsp; Reuse pre-defined interfaces & combine with existing Opyrators.
- üìà&nbsp; Instantly deploy and scale for production usage.

## Getting Started

### Installation

> _Requirements: Python 3.6+._

```bash
pip install opyrator
```

### Usage

1. A simple Opyrator-compatible function could look like this:

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class Input(BaseModel):
        text: str

    class Output(BaseModel):
        text: str

    def hello_world(input: Input) -> Output:
        return Output(text=input.text)
    ```
    _Requirements: The function needs to be annotated with typing hints, and the `input` parameter and return value needs to be based on [Pydantic models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)._

2. Copy this code to a file `my_opyrator.py`
3. Run the UI server from command-line:

    ```bash
    opyrator launch-ui my_opyrator:hello_world
    ```
    _In the output, there's a line that shows where your web app is being served, on your local machine._

    TODO: Add screenshot

4. Run the REST API server from command-line:

    ```bash
    opyrator launch-api my_opyrator:hello_world
    ```
    _In the output, there's a line that shows where your web service is being served, on your local machine._

    TODO: Add screenshot

### REST API

With Opyrator, you can instantly launch a local HTTP (REST) API server for any [compatible function](#compatible-functions):

```bash
opyrator launch-api my_opyrator:hello_world
```

This will launch a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) server based on the [OpenAPI standard](https://swagger.io/specification) and with an automatic interactive documentation.

_TODO: Add Screenshot_

_üí° Make sure that all requirements of your script are installed in the active Python enviornment._

The port used by the API server can be provided via CLI arguments:

```bash
opyrator launch-api my_opyrator:hello_world --port 8080
```

The API server can also be started via the exported zip-file format (see [zip export section](#zip-export) below).

```bash
opyrator launch-api my-opyrator.zip
```

### Graphical UI

You can launch a graphical user interface - powered by  [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - for your [compatible function](#compatible-functions). The UI is auto-generated from the input- and output-schema of the given function.

```bash
opyrator launch-ui my_opyrator:hello_world
```

_TODO: Screenshot_

_üí° Make sure that all requirements of your script are installed in the active Python environment._

You can influence most aspects of the UI just by changing and improving the input- and output-schema of your function. Furthermore, it is also possible to define custom UIs for the function's input and output. For more details, refer to the [input- and output-schema](#TODO) section.

The port used by the UI server can be provided via CLI arguments:

```bash
opyrator launch-ui my_opyrator:hello_world --port 8080
```

The UI server can also be started via the exported zip-file format (see [zip export section](#zip-export) below).

```bash
opyrator launch-ui my-opyrator.zip
```

In addition, the UI server can be started by using an already running Opyrator API endpoint:

```bash
opyrator launch-ui http://my-opyrator:8080 
```

Thereby, all Opyrator calls from the UI will be executed via the configured HTTP endpoint instead of the Python function running inside the UI server.

### Command-line Interface

An Opyrator can also be executed via command-line:

```bash
opyrator call my_opyrator:hello_world '{"text": "hello", "wait": 1}'
```

_TODO: Add screenshot_

The CLI interface also works using the [zip export format](#zip-export):

```bash
opyrator call my-opyrator.zip '{"text": "hello", "wait": 1}'
```

Or, by using an already running Opyrator API endpoint:

```bash
opyrator call http://my-opyrator:8080 '{"text": "hello", "wait": 1}'
```

Thereby, the function call is executed by the Opyrator API server, instead of locally using the Python function.

### ZIP Export

Opyrator allows you to package and export a [compatible function](#compatible-functions) into a self-contained ZIP file:

```bash
opyrator export my_opyrator:hello_world my-opyrator.zip
```

This exported ZIP file packages relevant source code and data artifacts into a single file which can be shared, stored, and used for launching the API or UI as shown above.

External requirements are automatically discovered from the working directory based on the following files: `Pipfile` (Pipenv environment), `environment.yml` (Conda environment), `pyproject.toml` (Poetry dependencies), `requirements.txt` (PIP requirements), `setup.py` (Python project requirements), `packages.txt` (apt-get packages), or discovered via [pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs) as fallback. However, external requirements are only included as instructions and are not packaged into the ZIP file. If you want to export your Opyrator fully self-contained including all requirements or even the Python interpreter itself, please refer to the [Docker](#docker-export) or [PEX](#pex-export) export options.

As a side note, Opyrators exported as ZIP files are (mini) Python libraries that can be pip-installed, imported, and used from other Python code:

```bash
pip install my-opyrator.zip
```

_WIP: This feature is not finalized yet. You can track the progress and vote for the feature [here](#TODO)_

### Docker Export

In addition to the ZIP export, Opyrator also provides the capability to export to a Docker image:

```bash
opyrator export my_opyrator:hello_world --docker my-opyrator-image:latest
```

_üí° The Docker export requires that Docker is installed on your machine._

After the successful export, the Docker image can be run as shown below:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-opyrator-image:latest
```

Running your Opyrator within this Docker image has the advantage that only a single port is required to be exposed. The separation between UI and API is done via URL paths: `http://localhost:8080/api` (API); `http://localhost:8080/ui` (UI). The UI is automatically configured to use the API for all function calls.

_WIP: This feature is not finalized yet. You can track the progress and vote for the feature [here](#TODO)._

### PEX Export

Opyrator also provides the capability to export to a PEX file. [PEX](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex) is a tool to create self-contained executable Python environments that contain all relevant python dependencies.

```bash
opyrator export my_opyrator:hello_world --pex my-opyrator.pex
```

_WIP: This feature is not finalized yet. You can track the progress and vote for the feature [here](#TODO)._

### Python Client

Every deployed Opyrator provides a Python client library via an endpoint method which can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install http://my-opyrator:8080/client
```

And used in your code, as shown below:

```python
from my_opyrator import Client, Input
opyrator_client = Client("http://my-opyrator:8080")
result = opyrator_client.call(Input(text="hello", wait=1))
```

_WIP: This feature is not finalized yet. You can track the progress and vote for the feature [here](#TODO)._

### Pre-defined Interfaces

Opyrator provides a growing collection of pre-defined interfaces (input- and output schemas) for common tasks. Some of these interfaces also provide more advanced UIs and Visualizations. You can reuse these schemas to speed up your development and, thereby, also keep your Opyrators compatible to other functionality improvements or other Opyrators.

You can find some of the available interfaces in the [examples](#examples) section or in this [source code package](#TODO).

_WIP: This feature is not finalized yet. You can track the progress and vote for the feature [here](#TODO)._

### Production Deployment

Rolling out your Opyrators for production usage might require additional features such as SSL, authentication, API tokens, unlimited scalability, load balancing, and monitoring. Therefore, we provide capabilities to easily  deploy your Opyrators directly on scalable and secure cloud platforms without any major overhead:

```bash
opyrator deploy my_opyrator:hello_world <deployment-provider> <deployment-provider-options>
```

_WIP: This feature is not finalized yet. You can track the progress and vote for the feature [here](#TODO)._

## Documentation

### Compatible Functions

A function is compatible with Opyrator if it fullfills the following requirements:

- A single parameter called `input` which MUST be a subclass of the [Pydantic BaseModel](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/).
- A single return value which MUST be a subclass of the [Pydantic BaseModel](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/).
- The `input` parameter and return value MUST be annotated with Python typing hints.

### Input- and Output-Schema

_TODO_

These input- and output-models are used to generate the REST API and Web UI.

_TODO: Add mapping table between JSON Schema and UI elements._

### Command-line Interface

_TODO: Add `help` output of CLI_

## Examples

_TODO: Add examples_
