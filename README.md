Opyrator enables you to instantly turn a simple Python function into a powerful web service that includes a REST API and a full-blown graphical UI. It can be saved & shared as self-contained executable file and instantly deployed & scaled for production usage. Opyrator is powered by Pydantic, FastAPI, and Streamlit and enables you to build your web apps and services within seconds.

## Highlights

- ü™Ñ&nbsp; Turn functions into production-ready services within seconds.
- üîå&nbsp; Auto-generated REST API based on FastAPI.
- üåÖ&nbsp; Auto-generated UI based on Streamlit.
- üì¶&nbsp; Save and share as self-contained executable file.
- üìà&nbsp; Instantly deploy and scale for production usage.
- Export to Docker, Pex, ...

## Getting Started

### Installation

> _Requirements: Python 3.6+._

```bash
pip install opyrator
```

### Usage

1. A simple opyrator-compatible function could look like this:

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    import time

    def Input(BaseModel):
        text: str
        wait: int

    def Output(BaseModel):
        text: str

    def hello_world(input: Input) -> Output:
        time.sleep(input.wait)
        return Output(text=input.text)
    ```
    _Requirements: The function needs to be annotated with typing hints, and the `input` parameter and return value needs to be based on [Pydantic Models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)._

2. Copy this code to a file `opyrator.py`
3. Run the UI server from command-line:

    ```
    opyrator launch-ui opyrator:hello_world
    ```
    _In the output, there's a line that shows where your web app is being served, on your local machine._

    TODO: Add screenshot

4. Run the REST API server from command-line:

    ```
    opyrator launch-api opyrator:hello_world
    ```
    _In the output, there's a line that shows where your web service is being served, on your local machine._

    TODO: Add screenshot

## Development

> _**Requirements**: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation) are required to be installed on your machine to execute the containerized build process._

To simplify the process of building this project from scratch, we provide build-scripts - based on [universal-build](https://github.com/ml-tooling/universal-build) - that run all necessary steps (build, check, test, and release) within a containerized environment. To build and test your changes, execute the following command in the project root folder:

```bash
act -b -j build
```

Refer to our [contribution guides](https://github.com/ml-tooling/opyrator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-instructions) for more detailed information on our build scripts and development process.
