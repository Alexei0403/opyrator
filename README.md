- The [development section](#development) below contains information on how to build and test the project after you have implemented some changes.

## Development

> _**Requirements**: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation) are required to be installed on your machine to execute the containerized build process._

To simplify the process of building this project from scratch, we provide build-scripts - based on [universal-build](https://github.com/ml-tooling/universal-build) - that run all necessary steps (build, check, test, and release) within a containerized environment. To build and test your changes, execute the following command in the project root folder:

```bash
act -b -j build
```

Refer to our [contribution guides](https://github.com/ml-tooling/opyrator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-instructions) for more detailed information on our build scripts and development process.
